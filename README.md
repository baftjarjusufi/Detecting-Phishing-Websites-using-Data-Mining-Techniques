# Detecting-Phishing-Websites-using-Data-Mining-Techniques
The aim of the project is to develop an ideal model for determining the possibility of the website being a phishing website or a legitimate one using data mining techniques. We will start with the code we developed and explain step by step, in PYTHON.

### Machine Learning Models & Training :

-Decision Tree
Decision trees are widely used models for classification and regression tasks. Essentially, they learn a hierarchy of if/else questions, leading to a decision. Learning a decision tree means learning the sequence of if/else questions that gets us to the true answer most quickly.

-Random Forest Classifier
Random forests or random decision forests is an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and other tasks that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time. For classification tasks, the output of the random forest is the class selected by most trees. For regression tasks, the mean or average prediction of the individual trees is returned.

-Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs): Deep Learning
The field of artificial neural networks is often just called neural networks or multi-layer perceptrons after perhaps the most useful type of neural network. A perceptron is a single neuron model that was a precursor to larger neural networks.

-Bagging Classifier
A Bagging classifier is an ensemble meta-estimator that fits base classifiers each on random subsets of the original dataset and then aggregate their individual predictions (either by voting or by averaging) to form a final prediction.

## Roadmap

- The future implementation will be an online implemented web application , where can be accessed at any time and any browser desired , it will be also a lot more mobile friendly and that can be downloaded from the Appstore or even playstore to be accessed also on the phones , tablets , on all the devices.

- Incorporating and inviting multiple organizations with customized theme or private personalized rooms with a special code to each of them so people can join , to be accessed all around the world. 

## Lessons Learned

In conclusion, this project has been a valuable learning experience in Python and Machine learning models in data mining. It allowed me to gain practical knowledge in building a web application that facilitates the manipulation, management, and searches of different data with different data machine existing models techniques. Through this project, I have mastered essential Data Mining concepts, Python.
