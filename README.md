# Detecting-Phishing-Websites-using-Data-Mining-Techniques
The aim of the project is to develop an ideal model for determining the possibility of the website being a phishing website or a legitimate one using data mining techniques. We will start with the code we developed and explain step by step, in PYTHON.

### Machine Learning Models & Training :

-Random Forest Classifier
Random forests or random decision forests is an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and other tasks that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time. For classification tasks, the output of the random forest is the class selected by most trees. For regression tasks, the mean or average prediction of the individual trees is returned.

-Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs): Deep Learning
The field of artificial neural networks is often just called neural networks or multi-layer perceptrons after perhaps the most useful type of neural network. A perceptron is a single neuron model that was a precursor to larger neural networks.

-Bagging Classifier
A Bagging classifier is an ensemble meta-estimator that fits base classifiers each on random subsets of the original dataset and then aggregate their individual predictions (either by voting or by averaging) to form a final prediction.

## Roadmap

- The future implementation will be an online implemented web application , where can be accessed at any time and any browser desired , it will be also a lot more mobile friendly and that can be downloaded from the Appstore or even playstore to be accessed also on the phones , tablets , on all the devices.

- Incorporating and inviting multiple organizations with customized theme or private personalized rooms with a special code to each of them so people can join , to be accessed all around the world. 

- The application aims to provide users with personalized themes that they can choose from, as well as a wide range of customization options. It offers a direct messaging service that allows users to securely communicate with individuals they are interested in or their friends, based on specific topics or rooms. Additionally, users have the ability to follow others within the web application and receive notifications whenever they create a new room or make a post, keeping them updated on their activities.

- To add tasks for organizations to help their students more for the studying aspect. To add more gamification elements , such as badges , achievements , a ranking leaderboard , to motivate people engagement and foster a competitive learning platform. Incorporating a virtual classroom where people can hop on the video sessions with friends , colleagues , talk , share resources there. To add more supported languages in the platform so to support a wider global audience.

## Lessons Learned

In conclusion, this project has been a valuable learning experience in Django web development. It allowed me to gain practical knowledge in building a web application that facilitates the creation, management, and interaction of users within a website application. Through this project, I have mastered essential Django concepts, HTML, CSS and Javascript concepts including user authentication, database modeling, form handling, the use of the Django Admin interface, making the front end django friendly , incorporating the back-end with front-end together.
